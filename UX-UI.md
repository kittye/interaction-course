UX = user experience
UI = user interface

The user experience is the sum of all user interaction, analog and digital. 
User interaction: Identity of the company, the product, the shop, the service & contact, 
the employees and their behavior, marketing campaign, pr, commercial, etc...

When designing UI keep UX in mind.

TIPS for the way of thinking:
* think in the perspective of the user 
* think in senarios (users are always in a hurry)
* don't think flat, think 3demensinal 
* think logical
* take distance
* be transparence 
* think in movement & motion
* think analog (room & space)
* combine analog & digital
